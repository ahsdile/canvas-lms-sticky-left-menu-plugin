# Canvas LMS Sticky Left Menu Plug-in

Plugin for the [Canvas LMS theme app](https://github.com/ahsdile/canvas-lms-app) that makes the left menu stick to the
top of the window when scrolling. This applies to the left menu inside courses, groups, admin settings, ...
Technically, it's not really a plug-in because it only contains styles so it doesn't have to be added to the main app.

Using NPM:

    npm install @ahsdile/canvas-lms-sticky-left-menu-plugin

Using Yarn:

    yarn add @ahsdile/canvas-lms-sticky-left-menu-plugin

## Usage

Just import the plug-in's CSS file:

```javascript
import '@ahsdile/canvas-lms-sticky-left-menu-plugin/index.css';
